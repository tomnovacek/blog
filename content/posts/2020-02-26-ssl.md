## HTTPS

* **Content integrity:**Without HTTPS, free Wi-Fi services can inject ads into your pages.
* **Security:**If your site has a login or accepts form submissions, HTTPS is essential for your users' security and privacy.
* **SEO:**Google search results prioritize sites with HTTPS enabled.
* **Referral analytics:**HTTPS-enabled sites will not send referral data to sites without HTTPS enabled.
* **HTTP/2:**Boost your sites' performance —[HTTP/2](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/#http-2)requires HTTPS.

### Let`s Encrypt

#### ACME

For those who have an existing HTTPS website, CDN, and services at different providers.

The DNS-01 validation method [works like this](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge): to prove that you control`www.example.com`, you create a TXT record at `_acme-challenge.www.example.com` with a “digest value” as specified by ACME (your ACME client should take care of creating this digest value for you). When the TXT record is ready, your ACME client informs the ACME server (for instance, Let’s Encrypt) that the domain is ready for validation. The ACME server looks up the TXT record, compares it to the expected digest value, and if the result is correct, considers your account authorized to issue for`www.example.com`. Your new customer can set up this TXT record (or a CNAME) without interfering with normal website operations.

> Avoid rate limiting for subdomains
>
> If you have more than 5 aliases that are subdomains of the same domain, you might run into rate limits with our certificate provider. In that case we recommend you provide your own wildcard certificate using Netlify DNS or[contact support](https://www.netlify.com/support)for our assistance for getting them set up with our certificate provider. Please do this*before adding any aliases*for best results!
