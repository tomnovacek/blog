Apache Subversion which is often abbreviated as SVN, is a software versioning and revision control system distributed under an open source license. Subversion was created by CollabNet Inc. in 2000, but now it is developed as a project of the Apache Software Foundation, and as such is part of a rich community of developers and users.
